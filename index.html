        <h2 id="sec2">What is Unemployment?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A person is said to be unemployed if he/she, despite being physically and mentally fit to work, is unable to find a job. The economy of a country is highly dependent upon employment. High rate of unemployment leads to economic distress. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Unemployment is persons above a specified age (usually above 15) not being in paid employment or self-employment but currently available for work during the reference period.”</p>
        <h3 id="sec3">Types of Unemployment</h3>
        <p>Before discussing about unemployment issue and it’s causes, let’s discuss about the types of unemployment. The following are some of the major types of Unemployment: </p>
        <h4>Rural Unemployment</h4>
        <p>Around  85.90 percent of Assam’s population live in Rural areas. But, there are not enough employment opportunities in those rural areas. This, gives rise to unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>
        <h4>Seasonal unemployment</h4>
        <p>As stated above, Around  85.90 percent of Assam’s population live in Rural areas. So, a large population of Assam is highly dependent upon agricultural. But, they can’t grow their crops all year round. During off-season, they go completely unemployed.</p>
        <h4>Urban Unemployment</h4>
        <p>With more and more people moving to urban area in search of jobs, urban unemployment is also growing.</p>
        <h4>Industrial Unemployment</h4>
        <p>People who are willing to work in factories or industries in urban areas but cannot find work fall in this category.</p>
        <h4>Educated Unemployment</h4>
        <p>People who are educated but are unable to find a job that best matches their qualifications fall in this category. With the growing literacy rates, educated unemployment is also growing.</p>
        <h4>Technological Unemployment</h4>
        <p>This type of unemployment occurs every time a new technology arrives and the existing workforce are unable to cope with the new technology. They become unemployed when they are unable to adapt to the new technology. This type is unemployment is constantly growing with technological advancements. </p>
        <h3 id="sec4">Effects of unemployment</h3>
        <p>The major effects of unemployment are given below:</p>
        <h4>Impact on Individuals</h4>
        <ol>

            <li><b><u>Life expectancy:</u></b> The unemployed people are unable to afford healthcare facilities which shortens their lifespan. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Impact on Society</h4>
        <ol>

            <li><b><u>Crime rates:</u></b> The unemployed people can not afford or access some essential services which lowers their standards of living.</li>
            <li><b><u>Life expectancy:</u></b> Studies have revealed that a unemployed person may involve in criminal activities to meet their economic needs.</li>

        <hr>
        <p>The population censuses, different quinquennial rounds of National sample Survey on employment data, Employment and Unemployment Surveys conducted by the Labour Bureau and Economic Census provides data on employment structure and workforce as well as involvement of human resources in economic activity, employment etc. On the other hand, the data available from the Employment Exchanges does not give a clear picture on unemployment as a large number of unemployed people either did not register their names with Employment Exchanges or those who secure employment through other channels do not delete their names from the records of Employment Exchanges.</p>
        <p>The Census of India collects information on economic activity of an individual and classifies workers into two groups namely, Main workers and Marginal workers. Main workers are those who had worked for the major part of the reference period i.e. six months or more and Marginal workers are those who had worked less than six months. The following table shows the trend of Main workers, Marginal workers and Non-workers in Assam according to the last three censuses.</p>

        <p>The Figure below shows that proportion of main workers to total population in Assam has decreased from 31 percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2011 although the figures in absolute number has increased by 24 percent between the period 1991 to 2011. On the other hand, the proportion of marginal workers shows an increasing trend both in percentage share and absolute number during the period. The proportion of non-workers to total population although remained more or less at the same level (about 64 percent) in 1991 and 2001, it showed a slight decline in 2011.</p>

        <h2 id="sec13">Unemployment in Assam: Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Unemployment has always been a major problem in Assam. Although, the GDP and the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) of the state expanded between 2011-12 and 2016-17, the job market in Assam is quiet disappointing. According to a report published in October 2017 by the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Limited (NEDFL), over 1.75 lakh jobs will be required by the state annually till 2020. However, the report didn't include employment in agriculture and plantation farm sectors and government offices. So, this requirement is even more. Employment in Assam is not growing at the same pace of mushrooming young population. Therefore, Assam is currently facing a twin issue.</p>
        <h3 id="sec14">Current scenario</h3>
        <p>According to report published by the State Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department on November 2018, there are a total of 19,63,376 registered unemployed in the state, out of which 16,65,866 are educated or skilled and 2,97,510 are unskilled.</p>

        <p>The report also stated that there are 942 unemployed medical graduates, 7,804 jobless engineering graduates, 327 jobless veterinary graduates, 832 jobless agri graduates, 16,576 jobless postgraduates, 3,17,8 24 general graduates, 6,82,796 HS-passed candidates, 5,67,340 HSLC-passed candidates, 9,167 diploma holders, 16,121 ITI certificate holders and 46,137 others in the state.</p>

        <p>The number of the educated job seekers is considerably high, which is a challenge before the growing economy of the State. According to the live register of Employment Exchanges, there were 1642718 registered educated job seekers during 2016 against 1523531 during 2015. That means is grew by 7.82 percent during 2016. The percentage of educated job seekers constitutes about 82 percent of the total job-seekers. The overall registration of educated job seekers as per record of Employment Exchanges has increased by 9 percent in 2016 over the previous year. A noticeable development has been observed in registration at all levels of education during 2016. Unlike in the previous year’s, number of educated job seekers has increased at all level of education in 2016 over 2015. The year, 2016 depicts an increase in registration of Engineering Graduates (59%), Medical Graduates (107%), Agriculture Graduates (90%), Veterinary Graduates (100%), ITI passed (2.5%), Post Graduates (3.7%), Diploma holders(255%) and Others (166%).</p>

        <h2 id="sec15">Causes of Unemployment in Assam</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The following are the main causes of unemployment in Assam: </p>
        <h3>lack of Skills</h3>
        <p>The fact that a large number of people are unemployed is mainly because they do not have the skills required for a job. </p>
        <h3 id="sec16">Immigration</h3>
        <p>People can move from any state to any state in search of job. Infact, many people from Assam have moved to different states of India to work. So, should immigration be termed as a cause of unemployment in Assam? But, the real question is whether there are enough jobs in the state to employ its own people? Answer is a Big No. 
        There are not adequate jobs to employ people of the state. But, every year many people move to Assam from other neighbouring states of India as well as neighbouring countries. </p>
        <h3 id="sec17">Population growth</h3>
        <p>The population of Assam grew from 3.29 million in 1901 to 6.70 million in 1941. It increased to 14.63 million in 1971 and 22.41 million in 1991. It increased to 26,655,528 in 2001 and 31,205,576  in 2011. Which means it grew by a rate of 17.1% in 2011. But, the employment rate did not grow at the same rate. Hence, unemployment rate kept on rising.</p>
        <h3 id="sec18">lack of adequate fund-allocation</h3>
        <p>Improper governmental programs targeting the unemployed population can harm the employment situation of the state. Lack of commitment to adress the job crisis causes employment to fall.</p>
        <h3 id="sec19">Role of Government</h3>
        <p>The government can play a major role in solving the job crisis in the states. Finding and implementing methods to solve this issue is completely in the hands of the government. But, due to lack of commitment, unemployment remained unsolved.</p>
        <h3 id="sec20">Slow rate of economic growth</h3>
        <p>Slow economic growth also causes unemployment. Slow economic growth implies that there are not ample jobs to absorb the unemployed people who are able and willing to work.</p>
        <h2 id="sec21">Suggestions to Solve Unemployment Problem</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Although, unemployment is a complex issue, it's not impossible to to rectify it. Proper planning and implementation of better methods in a productive way may definitely solve this issue. Given below are some methods that could be helpful:</p>
        <h3 id="sec22">Change in education system</h3>
        <p>It’s very important to change the current educational pattern. Students who are interested in higher studies should be admitted in colleges and universities. Qualified engineers should be encouraged to start their own small units.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> An improved and better education patter will increase the competence among the youth of Assam and enable them to provide employment to others.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec23">Policy regarding seasonal unemployment</h3>
        <p>Seasonal unemployment occurs in agriculture sector and agro based industries. In order to solve this, this following should be done:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Agriculture should have multiple cropping,</li>
            <li>Plantations, horticulture, dairying and animal husbandry should be encouraged,</li>
            <li>Cottage industries should be encouraged.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> This will reduce seasonal unemployment as farmers will be able to involve in agricultural activities all year round.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec24">Change in industrial technique</h3>
        <p>Production technique should match with the needs and means of the state. Capital intensive technology should be replaced with Labour intensive technology.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Labour intensive technology require more people so this can help increase employment opportunities.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec25">Expansion of Employment exchanges</h3>
        <p>More employment exchanges should be set up. Information regarding employment opportunities should be given to people.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> This will facilitate the unemployed people to find a suitable job and industries to find suitable manpower.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec26">Setting up skill development center</h3>
        <p>North-east skill development center is located at Garchuk, Guwahati. But, that is not enough to train every unskilled worker of Assam. More such centers should be opened in different parts of the state.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Those who are unskilled, will be able to reach these centers and get trained which will help them get a job.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec27">More assistance to self employed people</h3>
        <p>People who are engaged in agriculture, trade, cottage and small scale industries etc. should be helped financially, providing raw materials and technical training.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Proving assistance and resources will not only empower those who are self-employed but will also encourage others to choose self-employment.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec28">Full and more productive employment</h3>
        <p>The main objective of states’s employment policy should be to increase employment opportunities and productivity of labour. Govt. should adopt a policy that provides employment to all people.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Adopting better policies will bring employment opportunities for a large number of people.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec29">Increase in Production</h3>
        <p>It is important to increase production in agriculture and industrial sectors in order to increase employment. Development of small and cottage industries should be encouraged.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> When production increases, the needs for workers also increases. So, increasing production will give rise to unemployment opportunities.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec30">High rate of capital formation</h3>
        <p>Rate of capital formation in the country should be accelerated. Capital formation should be particularly encouraged in such activities which generate greater employment opportunities. Capital output ratio should be kept low.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> When production increases, the needs for workers also increases. So, increasing production will give rise to unemployment opportunities.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec31">Industries in co-operative sector</h3>
        <p>The Govt. should take necessary steps to encourage Industries in co-operative sector in the state. This could help solve unemployment issue up to a great extent.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Kerala Govt. set up a textile mill covering 600 unemployed persons on co-operative basis. Following this step may give similar results in Assam.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec32">Encouraging start-ups</h3>
        <p>The government should encourage the youth to have their own start-up ideas. They should be provided with proper training and funds to implement their ideas. </p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Those who have any start-up idea, will be able to provide employment to those who are willing to work.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec33">Decentralisation of industrial activity</h3>
        <p>The Govt. should adopt policies which encourage decentralisation of industrial activity. Decentralisation of Industrial activity is necessary to reduce unemployment. There will be less employment opportunities in the under developed areas if industrial activities are centralised at one place.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Decentralisation will increase industrial activities in the state which will increase the need of workforce.</i></h3>
        <h3 id="sec34">Population control</h3>
        <p>In order to solve unemployment issue, the growth of population should be kept in control. Family planning programme should be implemented in an effective manner.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Keeping population in check will help the government lower unemployment rate of the state.</i></p>
        <h3 id="sec35">Designate tax free zones</h3>
        <p>The should open up Special economic zone that will offer the foreign investors tax and customs incentives. This method is used by other Indian states like Goa, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, etc.</p>
        <p><i><b>Probable outcome:</b> Offering tax incentives will attract foreign investors. More investments in the state will generate jobs for the unemployed people.</i></p>
        
        <h2 id="sec36">Our solutions to counter unemployment</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To counter seasonal employment:<br>
                Eg: For Crop related harvesting, as we know, there are types of crops like Rabi and Kharif. If we grow Rabi crops in a particular season, harvested at the end of March, we can grow kharif crops From June to September, meaning we can harvest different crops in the same season.<br>
                Research teams headed by scientists, testing the fields may be divided from village to village. This serves two purposes<br>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Reasearch teams may be graduates of chemistry or medical science who are unemployed at that moment, but have got employment opportunities by this effort.</li>
                    <li>The crops when divided by seasons and based on the fields they are grown in will provide more scope for growth of more crops.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               Databases are to be made of all the unemployed people and their qualifications. Their database will be exchanged with the neighbouring districts.
               <br>Eg: There are 55 unemployef civil engineers and our neighbouring state needs people to build the 27th National Highway. We can send our unemployed engineers, while exchanging them with people we need, like teachers.
            </li>
            <li>
            There are many jobs that require more than a handful of people  In OIL and IOCL. They have a few people for a particular job, like watching over the filtering systems. That person is paid a lot and has to cover a lot of shifts. If instead of 5 people, 20 are appointed and divided in shifts more employment opportunities arise.
            </li>
            <li>We have to make jobs accessible to general public and people who supply are filtered in a computerized system, To have maximum appointed people.</li>
            <li>To ensure regular salaries, we must make Databases that look over the salary paid.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="sec37">Roadmap</h3>
        <p>We divide our work based on three types:
            <ul>
                <li>Database based work</li>
                <li>Individual based</li>
                <li>Output based</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>January, 2024</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Databases are uploaded with the number of people and their specializations.</li>
                <li>Our people continue to scout areas of lesser spotlight.</li>
                <li>Public awareness of our initiative is made. Our suggestions are sent to companies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>February – April, 2024</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Examination held/merit basis division for our specific posts like teachers.</li>
                <li>Fields of villages are inspected and reports of the accessible crops given within a fortnight.</li>
                <li>Companies where work can be divided in multiple shifts and more individuals are listed.</li>
            </ul>
        </p> 
        <h4>May – December, 2024</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Databases continue to examine more people and qualifications.</li>
                <li>Effective pay method assurances to be met by our people.</li>
                <li>Division of crops made in April on field studies are made and output checked.</li>
            </ul>

        Planning and execution strategy 
        <h3 id="sec38">Planning and execution strategy </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We will form a team to initialize our works.</li>
            <li>We will hire people for our Research team, Database Team and Training team.</li>
            <li>We will create a system to keep track of our works in real-time. Our team members will have to give updates about their progress though that tracking system.We will create a system to keep track of our works in real-time. Our team members will have to give updates about their progress though that tracking system.</li>
            <li>We will explain our plans to the gram panchayats and ask for necessary permissions.</li>
            <li>We will collect unemployment data and conduct surveys if required.</li>
            <li>Our database entry team will update our database and Research team will provide soil testing data.</li>
            <li>We create a automatic system to create job profiles using the database. We may also share our databases with other job matching platforms.</li>
            <li>We will launch a website to make our initiative transparent.</li>
            <li>We will start social media channels to spread the word through the internet. We will also start offline campaigns in rural areas to raise awareness about our initiative. </li>
            <li>Our training team will visit the villages and dicuss with the farmers about different crops that can be grown in different seasons.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="sec39">Efficiency of our plan</h3>
        <p>We will do this in a phased manner. We will start with small nearby villages. We will search and include more people who may be interested to work with us. So, our plan itself has some employment opportunities. When we will have a bigger team team and more funds, we will try to visit every corner of Assam.</p>
        <h3 id="sec40">Are our solutions Unique?</h3>
        <p>We don't claim our solutions to be unique since these are some standard solutions used around the world and gave satisfactory results in most cases. We are also fully aware of the fact that someone somewhere might have even better and more effective solutions in their mind. In that case, we would like to know their ideas and join hands with them to solve unemployment issue together.</p>
        <h3 id="sec41">Impact on environment</h3>
        <p>Our solutions do not seem have any negative impact of the environment since we are only dealing with Soil testing on available agricultural lands only and Database entry in digital mode. Moreover, we will not consume any natural resources. Although, there will be consumption of electricity during database entry, we don't think it should raise any concern.</p>
        <h3 id="sec42">Impact on society</h3>
        <p>Our chief goal is to reduce unemployment in Assam. We think that our initiative will definitely help the unemployed people in finding a sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. Since, majority of Assam’s population is dependent upon agriculture, so our prime focus is to reduce seasonal unemployment. We hope that our initiative will reduce seasonal unemployment in rural areas of Assam. Moreover, by creating a database of unemployed people we will have a clear picture of how big the issue is, and be able to solve it accordingly. Our automatic profile making and job matching platform will also help those who are skilled but unemployed.</p>
        <h3 id="sec43">Future Goals</h3>
        <p>If everything goes according to plan and we get positive results, we would like to visit every remote villages of Assam. The proximity of our initiative shall continue to expand in the future. We shall be open to companies, Organisations and teams who share a common goal. We also will seek financial support from the government and raise funds. We shall continue to update our databases so that we can have a clear picture of unemployment in Assam and provide opportunities to more people.</p>       

        <h2 id="sec44">Conclusion</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Unemployment is a big problem. Every developing country is dealing with this. This issue can not be solved within a day or even a year. It may take years. But, immediate measures are required to solve this issue. Proper planning and Governance will definitely solve this issue one day.</p>
